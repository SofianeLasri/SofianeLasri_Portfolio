After my bachelor's year at the IUT of Orsay, I planned to move towards a specialized course in game development and creation. But for that, I first had to find a work-study program. Unlike a work-study program in web development, it is surprisingly extremely difficult. But I eventually received a response to one of my applications. They then asked me to make a demo by copying their game.

I had a lot of fun with it, but I wasn't accepted. And anyway, I'm not sure I would have liked working there. The performance is commendable, even though honestly, the code is really not good*.

*\*The game's physics are calculated at each frame. This means that if your phone lags a bit, you can literally pass over the water without it being detected.*

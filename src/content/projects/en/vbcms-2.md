VBcms is my first major project in web development.

At that time, I was developing many small websites with similar architecture. One day, I thought it would be interesting to create a common base that I could modify at will to speed up the development process.

Thus, the VBcms project was born. Originally, it was just a simple loading screen manager for Garry's Mod. But quickly, I started developing a new version intended to be much more modular, which was supposed to manage any type of web content.

In developing this project, I learned a lot. Almost all my basics in web programming, whether in PHP, JS, or even CSS, were acquired with this project. Ultimately, VBcms resembled more of a microframework with a rather primitive operation, but laying the foundations of a system that standardized web project development.

However, it is important to note that at that time, I had no knowledge of object-oriented programming, nor even concerning frameworks (I didn't even know what they were). That's also why the project is a vast mix of procedural and object-oriented programming.

When I joined [Kang](https://kang.fr) for my first paid internship in a company, I learned to use the Laravel framework. That's when I realized that what I had been developing for over a year was exactly the definition of a framework. However, my project being undocumented, poorly organized, and filled with bad coding practices, I decided to abandon it. Additionally, its interest had become completely null in my eyes. Laravel is by far much more powerful, more complete, and above all, much better designed.

But I remain quite proud of this project. It was extremely instructive for me and remains a fine piece of work in my eyes.

**Note:** VBcms stands for "Very Basic Content Management System". :)

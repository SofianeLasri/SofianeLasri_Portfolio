To complete my PRISM bachelor's degree, I had to create a small project based on Django, a Python web framework.
Honestly, we didn't have much time, only about 2 weeks. So I created the site as quickly as possible, and here is the result.

It's not too bad, but still far from great... x)

For this project, I decided to use the name of the fictional racing team from GRID 2, and imagine what their website might have looked like at the time of the game (~2013). That's why it looks old despite being created in 2023. xD

Since it was the first time I used Django, it took me a little while to understand how it worked. I like its fairly simple approach and the tools it provides, such as its admin interface for managing the database. A kind of simplified PhpMyAdmin. However, its poor performance and the fact that it is based on Python make me think that I won't use it for other projects.

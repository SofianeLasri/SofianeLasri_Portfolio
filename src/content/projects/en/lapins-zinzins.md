This project is a school project with the objective of creating a mobile video game.
We decided to create a real-time multiplayer game in two dimensions, with an artistic direction strongly inspired by the game "Rabbids Go Home".

However, due to our lack of knowledge in video game creation, the multiplayer part could not be implemented and the level design was greatly simplified.

This project remains a great experience that I am quite satisfied with. :)
